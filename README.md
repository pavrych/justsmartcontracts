## Important

There is good news and bad news.

Good news is now I am rewriting JustSmartContracts.dev completely with up-to-date frameworks. So finally several current issues will be addressed and future ones could be resolved quickly.

Bad news is a current hosting subscription expires on the 7th of June and I don't plan to prolong it for the next year.
Instead I will try to find something free (like Netlify).

So for some time after said date (June 7th, 2023) the website will be unavailable. I will try to make the migration (both in code and in hosting) as quick as possible. However it is still possible to run a local copy of website using instructions below.

This README will be updated as soon as migration is finished.

See you.

## Description

This is source code of [justsmartcontracts.dev](https://justsmartcontracts.dev) website.

[What is justsmartcontracts.dev?](https://medium.com/coinmonks/introducing-justsmartcontracts-dev-web-tool-for-interacting-with-ethereum-smart-contracts-da9b5dfe563c) Basically it is a web tool for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts. It was initially developed by my friend and me in order to provide a better experience for Ethereum smart contracts developers and blockchain enthusiasts.

## Prerequisites

Website was developed using Node.js 8.4.0.

## Running locally

Download the project and navigate to the root folder (the one with this file), then execute

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

Website will be accessible on http://localhost:8080/

If you want website to use https instead of http, execute

`npm run devs`

To build the bundle, execute

`npm run build`

### Using local API server

You may want to use local backend application (API server). In that case please visit its [repository](https://github.com/olekon/justsmartcontracts-api) and follow launch instructions.

Then open this project's `config.js` file and locate `server` section. Set url to your local API server, for example

    server: {
        url: 'http://localhost:3000'
    }
